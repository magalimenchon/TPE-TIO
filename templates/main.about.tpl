                <h1>In defense of the abandoned animal</h1>
                <h3>We are a group of volunteers who share respect for the lives of animals and consider
                    them their equals, since they have the capacity to feel pleasure, joy, pain and suffering.</h3>
                <p>Our fight is continuous, and currently we rescue and help animals in Tandil, reaching more
                    than 4000 animals in need.</p>
                <p>We set up the Rescue Foundation to continue with our work, which consists of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rescue</li>
                    <li>Heal</li>
                    <li>Put up for adoption</li>
                    <li>Raise awareness about animal abuse</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We are convinced that the only ethical way to solve animal overpopulation is through
                    sterilization campaigns, which is why carrying them out is another of the Foundation's
                    pillars.</p>

                <h3>We created adoptame.com as a means to spread and find a home for our rescued in a more
                    practical way.</h3>
                <p>In this way, each future adopter can know all the necessary information about each of our
                    dogs and cats online, and with just one click, request their adoption</p>
                <p> Once the request has been notified, we start to develop a series of controls and follow-ups
                    to carry out the adoption</p>

                <h1>Adopting</h1>
                <h3>Adopting is an act of responsibility and commitment so it is important that you are trained
                    to do so. A dog or a cat can live between 14 and 18 years and during all that time dependent
                    on you.</h3>
                <p>Some issues to consider are the space available in your home, the time you have to provide
                    company, physical activity and care. Also the costs associated with their food, veterinary
                    care and stay during your vacation.</p>
                <p>To ensure a happy coexistence, your choice must be oriented to the lifestyle you lead and
                    the real time you can dedicate to it.</p>
                <p>Once the animals we rescued have been recovered, we try to find a home for them.
                    We also help independent protectionists find a home for their rescued animals.</p>
                <p>In this way, many animals were able to get permanent homes where they lead a life of
                    affection and care. We follow up on adoptions and stay in touch with adopters whenever
                    necessary.</p>
